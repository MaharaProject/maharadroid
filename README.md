[Deprecated] MaharaDroid was an Android application that allowed students to collect
their learning evidence, i.e. any file on their Android device, and then
upload it to their Mahara file area for inclusion in their portfolios.

The collection could happen offline and the transfer done on Wifi only or
via mobile internet.

This application was discontinued when Mahara Mobile was introduced, and it
is not maintained anymore.
